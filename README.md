### How to run our UserInterface

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Understand the File Structure

app.py: The main entry point for your Streamlit app. This file likely includes the UI components and logic to interact with your models and results.

DATA Folder: Contains all the results from your models. Ensure this folder is present and populated with relevant data for the app to display meaningful results.

data_integration.py: A utility script for summarizing the results generated by your models. This script might aggregate data, prepare summaries, or transform results for easier consumption by the Streamlit UI.
